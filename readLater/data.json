    "description": "The article from IGN discusses Nintendo's decision to charge $10 for the *Switch 2* tutorial game *Welcome Tour*, despite it being a basic introduction to the console. Nintendo explained that the game is not a free pack-in title because it offers substantial content and functionality, justifying the price. The company emphasized that the *Welcome Tour* provides valuable features for new users, making it worth the cost rather than being a complimentary offering. The article highlights fan reactions, with some expressing disappointment over the paid model for what is typically a free or bundled experience on other platforms.  \n\nWould you like any specific details expanded upon?",
